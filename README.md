# Egg Timer App

The Egg Timer app is a simple iOS application that helps users cook eggs with different levels of hardness. The app provides three buttons representing soft, medium, and hard-cooked eggs. When the user selects one of the buttons, the app displays the corresponding cooking time, and a progress bar visualizes the remaining cooking time.

## Features

The Egg Timer app includes the following features:

- Selecting the desired level of hardness for cooking eggs (soft, medium, or hard).
- Displaying the recommended cooking time for the selected hardness level.
- Visualizing the remaining cooking time with a progress bar.
- An alarm sound to alert once cooking is done.

## Learning Objectives

During the development of this app, I acquired knowledge and skills in various areas of iOS app development, including:

### Control Flow: If/Else and Switch Statements

I learned how to utilize conditional statements, such as if/else and switch statements, to implement different logic paths based on user input. In the Egg Timer app, I used these control flow structures to determine the appropriate cooking time based on the selected hardness level.

### Dictionaries

I discovered how to use dictionaries to store and retrieve data efficiently. In the Egg Timer app, I employed a dictionary to map each hardness level to its corresponding cooking time. This allowed for easy retrieval of the cooking time based on the user's selection.

### Optionals

I gained knowledge about optionals in Swift, which allowed me to handle situations where a value may be absent or have a `nil` state. In the Egg Timer app, I used optionals to handle cases where the cooking time could not be determined.

### UIProgressView

I explored the usage of the UIProgressView to provide visual feedback on the remaining cooking time. In the Egg Timer app, I utilized the UIProgressView to display a progress bar that dynamically updated as the cooking time progressed.

### Debugging

I learned various debugging techniques to identify and resolve issues within the app. Debugging helped me address potential errors, unexpected behavior, or incorrect logic during the development of the Egg Timer app.

### Sound

I practised my skill learnt from the Xylophone app to incorporate sound that works as an alarm, using AVFoundation I was able to implement the alarm feature and now feel confident in understanding how it works.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Open the project in Xcode.
3. Build and run the app on the iOS Simulator or a physical device.

## Acknowledgements

The Egg Timer app was developed as part of the iOS development curriculum of The App Brewery. I would like to acknowledge and thank The App Brewery for providing excellent tutorials and learning resources that helped me enhance my skills in iOS app development.
